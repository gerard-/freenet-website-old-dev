"<p>\n"
"The Freenet team is very happy to announce the stable release of Freenet 0.7.5 build 1468.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the \"node.updater.URI\" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"In this release, the way Freenet stores data locally has changed drastically by no longer using the now-deprecated db4o object storage. It is replaced with the product of toad's summer of work - a custom on-disk format that is much more robust against corruption and more efficient.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Existing unfinished downloads and uploads will be imported to a new format, which requires restarting them from the beginning.</li>\n"
"<li>Space for downloads is now all allocated at the start, so machines very low on disk space may run out, which causes downloads to temporarily fail until more space is available.</li>\n"
"<li>CHKs will change due to metadata bugfixes.</li>\n"
"<li>Some unofficial plugins will need to be updated because of API changes. Sone already works, as do all official plugins.</li>\n"
"<li>The queue format changes should make it extremely rare to lose the entire queue: the impact of corruption will almost always be localized.</li>\n"
"<li>Multi-container / site uploads can now be persistent, making it more practical to upload large sites.</li>\n"
"<li>Passworded physical security is now much stronger. (Full-disk encryption is still preferable.)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The Windows installer now defaults to starting Freenet on login.</li>\n"
"<li>There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/freenet/wintray\">new Windows tray app</a> with some useful features that is included with new installations. If you are using the existing Windows tray app you can download the new one <a href=\"https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/installer/FreenetTray.exe.build01468\">here</a>. No need to put it in a specific directory - it will try the default installation location and prompt if it can't find it.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The list of download keys moved from downloads/listFetchKeys.txt to downloads/listKeys.txt.</li>\n"
"<li>A list of upload keys is now available at uploads/listKeys.txt</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Gantros' index is now in the default bookmarks. It uses the same software as Enzo's index, which is no longer updated.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The obsolete and deprecated XMLLibrary and XMLSpider plugins are no longer officially supported. They will still load for those who have them added, but are no longer shown on the plugin page.</li>\n"
"<li>In the interests of releasing this build more quickly, the new version of FlogHelper does not support exporting and importing backups from the web UI. The old backup code did not work with the new Freenet version after removing db4o. People can instead back up \"plugins.floghelper.FlogHelper\" files in the plugin-data directory. These can be dropped into the directory after unloading FlogHelper to restore a backup.</li>\n"
"<li>ThawIndexBrowser works again. Thanks saces!</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Fred translations are updated.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Add two seed nodes, one sponsored by meshnet.pl - the Polish radio/meshnet darknet users group, and another run by ArneBab. Thanks!</li>\n"
"<li>Update existing seed node references.</li>\n"

"This release is planned to be the second-to-last version of Freenet to support Java 6\\. The version after this one will refuse to upgrade unless running on Java 7 or later.

"\n"
"*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)</a>\n"
"*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop](https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=3208).\n"
"*   Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has [more math behind it](https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/286) and will change when network parameters are adjusted.\n"
"*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!\n"

msgstr ""

#: pages/news.py:402
msgid ""
"According to [the press](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/), half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.\n"
"\n"
"This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html).\n"
"\n"
"On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#tor).\n"
"\n"
"Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major \"darknets\" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend \"darknet\". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.\n"
"\n"
"We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.\n"
"\n"
"Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!\n"
"\n"
"Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the \"freenet\" board on FMS.\n"

msgid ""
"Long time coder xor (also known as p0s) has agreed to work, in a paid role, for us on fixing the Web of Trust plugin. This is a crucial component of many Freenet plugins:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Sone**, an anonymous social network / microblogging tool.\n"
"*   **Freemail**, a private and untraceable email over Freenet system.\n"
"*   A filesharing system as yet unnamed which a student is working on.\n"
"*   Extensions to Infocalypse, being worked on by another student, a tool for managing source code which is vital to developing software over Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"See the Freenet Social Networking Guide for how to load the first 2 plugins.\n"
"\n"
"xor is well qualified for the role as he wrote most of the current code in the Web of Trust. The immediate priority will be to improve stability and performance by implementing a new more efficient FCP API. After that further optimisations are planned.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet relies on unpaid volunteer developers as well as a few key paid developers. Toad (Matthew Toseland) is returning to full time work for Freenet after a study break, although he is off to university in October, and xor is just starting working for Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"Improving the Web of Trust should substantially improve the performance of the key tools mentioned above and may be used by more in the future. Thanks to all our developers and donors!"

#: pages/news.py:441
msgid ""
"Some academics [have published](http://www.ee.hawaii.edu/~dong/traceback/index.htm) a couple of attacks against Freenet, and they appear to be working on more as part of a project to unmask anonymous Freenet users. Build 1411, which was released on the 3rd of September, makes their main attack largely impractical. Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the [other known attacks](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#attack). You can learn more about the attacks and our solution to them on our chief developer's [personal blog](http://amphibian.dyndns.org/flogmirror/#20120911-security).\n"
"\n"
"We welcome all work to understand Freenet's security and expose any problems with it, although we would suggest that next time they might let us know before they make the paper public, as is common practice in the security community.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the long term solution is to build a darknet, a Freenet network where people only connect directly to people they trust. That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack."

"Freenet is designed to resist censorship: The network must therefore be\n"

"especially for those who upload content in the first place. The typical\n"

"advance, must be able to move across the network relatively quickly, and must\n"
"be able to perform the attack while the data is being inserted; after that,\n"
"it is distributed across the network and is much harder to trace, and the\n"
"originator may have left the network. However, if by chance or by\n"

"engineer its operator! Freenet does support opennet mode (plug and play),\n"

"world where nodes can be operated safely, that the authors of controversial\n"
"content will be able to either host (hidden) web servers themselves or upload\n"
"it to other (hidden, but usually centralised) storage systems, and so on. And\n"
"Tor has a concept of a \"client\", which is somebody who uses the service\n"
"without providing any value to it; on Freenet, every node relays data for its\n"

"\n"
"We don't think so. Aside from protecting freedom of speech, Freenet is also\n"
"designed to be an efficient dynamic caching system. If information is\n"
"requested a lot from a limited number of nodes, the nodes that the requests\n"
"pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. If\n"
"information is inserted on a limited set of nodes and then subsequently\n"
"requested a lot from a separate set of nodes, with repetition, the sets will\n"
"close in on one another in the network topology until they are \"neighbors\"\n"
"and only the originally targeted nodes are suffering from the attack.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, in order to harm Freenet with a flood you need to\n"
"consistently change your point of entry into the network and continually\n"
"insert and request new data, and you will still only increase the workload\n"
"for the network that is linear to your own. Given an immense will and\n"

"First of all, we **strongly** suggest that you install Freenet inside an\n"
"encrypted drive using, for example, [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/).\n"
"It is not possible for Freenet to prevent all leaks of private data,\n"
"especially if you download media files etc. Even if you only browse freesites\n"
"and use the chat plugins, there will still be potentially incriminating data\n"
"in your swapfile, which needs to be encrypted (on recent versions of Windows\n"
"you could try the command \"fsutil behavior set encryptpagingfile 1\",\n"
"but really the solution is to encrypt your whole system including swap). It\n"
"is also essential that you use your web browser in privacy mode, or with\n"
"cache and history turned off; we try to do this if you launch Freenet via the\n"
"rabbit icon, but there are no guarantees as unfortunately this functionality\n"
"seems buggy in current web browsers. Browser plugins could also be a problem,\n"
"and you should use a separate browser for Freenet if in any doubt. Be careful\n"
"with the files you download from Freenet - not only could anyone seizing your\n"
"computer see you have them (media files are likely to be written to disk even\n"
"if you open them directly in your web browser and never save them), but also\n"
"they could contain threats to anonymity themselves, such as calling back to a\n"
"malicious website etc; this is possible in for instance PDFs and some video\n"
"formats. Freenet tries to warn you about this when it can't filter out such\n"
"malicious content: Currently it can only filter HTML pages, GIF/PNG/JPEG\n"
"images and CSS, and MP3s, but we will add support for Ogg soon and other\n"
"formats later. And of course there are many other threats - you should take\n"
"standard security precautions, such as not running operating systems that are\n"
"no longer updated, not running software not from a trustworthy source,\n"
"using appropriate security software etc (if you have a firewall make sure it\n"
"allows the two UDP ports Freenet needs through).\n"
"\n"
"Because not all users will have installed encrypted drives at the time when\n"
"they first install Freenet, Freenet itself attempts to encrypt all the\n"
